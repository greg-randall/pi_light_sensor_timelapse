# Raspberry Pi Long-Term Timelapse System

I'm building a timelapse camera setup to shoot months or years long timelapses. 

The pysical hardware needs to protect the camera, Raspberry Pi, battery, etc from water and dust while maintaing a clean window for the camera.

The software needs to calculate exposures for the photos, shoot the photos, and transfer them somewhere. 

The Raspberry Pi auto exposure doesn't work in low light, so I've included a light sensor to speed up finding the exposure

\*This power bank can do pass-through charging, so acts like a UPS for the Pi. In initial testing it seems to run the Pi and camera for around 1 day.
\*\*Good filters are really expensive. This filter seems to shed water and self clean much better than others I've tried.
