# Raspberry Pi Light Sensor Long-Term Timelapse

I'm building a timelapse camera setup to shoot months or years long timelapses. 

The Raspberry Pi auto exposure doesn't work well for low light and shooting test exposures in low light takes a long time. So, I've included a TSL2591 light sensor to make an initial reading of ambient light, so the first test exposure is close to being right.

I think all the parts are self-explanatory except for the power bank. This specific power bank can do pass-through charging, so acts like a UPS for the Pi. In initial testing it seems to run the Pi and camera for around 1 day.
