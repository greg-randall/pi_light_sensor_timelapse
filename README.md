# Raspberry Pi Light Sensor Long-Term Timelapse

I'm building a timelapse camera setup to shoot months or years long timelapses. 

The Raspberry Pi auto exposure doesn't work well for low light, and shooting test exposures in low light takes a long time. So, I've included a TSL2591 light sensor to make an initial reading of ambient light so the first test exposure is close to being right. 

## Parts List
|Item|Cost|
|---|---|
|Raspberry Pi Zero Camera Cable|$2.99|
|Raspberry Pi HQ Camera Wide Angle Lens|$30.00|
|Raspberry Pi HQ Camera|$50.00|
|Adafruit TSL2591 High Dynamic Range Digital Light Sensor|$6.95|
|Raspberry Pi Zero W|$10.00|
|RavPower 10000mAh 5V/3A Type-C Port Power Bank|$33.27|
|SanDisk 128GB Extreme microSDXC|$23.99|
|Ailkin USB Wall Charger|$8.99|

I think all the parts are self explanatory except for the power bank. This spesific power bank can do pass-through charging, so acts like a UPS for the Pi. In intial testing it seems to run the Pi and camera for around 1 day.
